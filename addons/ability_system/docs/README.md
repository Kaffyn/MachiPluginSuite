# Ability System (GAS) Documentation

The official documentation has been consolidated into the [GEMINI.md](../GEMINI.md) file, which serves as the "Architectural Bible" for this plugin.

Please refer to `GEMINI.md` and `README.md` in the root of the plugin for the most up-to-date information.

The previous documentation files in this directory are deprecated and have been removed to prevent confusion with the new AbilitySystemComponent architecture.
